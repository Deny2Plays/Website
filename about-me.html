        <h3>Hello!</h3>
        <p>I'm <span>15</span> years old boy from <span>Czechia</span>, passionate about <span>programming and nature.</span> I develop my skills mainly in <span>JavaScript</span>, specializing in creating <span>Discord bots</span> using the Discord.js library.<br><br>For me, it's fascinating to watch my ideas become reality through <span>coding.</span> Working on bots allows me to create <span>interactive</span> and <span>fun</span> features for <span>my community</span>. I'm not only driven by a passion for technology, but I also have a deep <span>appreciation</span> for <span>nature.</span><br><br>In my free time, you can often find me <span>exploring</span> the <span>outdoors,</span> enjoying the beauty of the natural world. Whether it's hiking through scenic landscapes or simply taking a moment to appreciate the <span>wonders of nature,</span> I believe in finding inspiration in the world around us.<br><br>If you have <span>any questions</span> about Discord.js, Javascript programming or something else, <span>just ask!</span> I will be happy to share my experience and provide <span>help</span> in creating bots or other projects!</p>
